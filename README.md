# Concert-Recommender
**Recommends concerts using the Spotify and Ticketmaster APIs**

This [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application gives users a collection of concerts (in the U.S.) that they may be interested in, based off of their top artists on their Spotify account.

## How To Use
To run this program from source you'll need to have Git and Node.js installed, your own API keys for both the [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/) and [Ticketmaster](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/) APIs, and then create a .env file (setup like the .env.example file) to place your API keys into.

```bash
#Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/StMrr/Concert-Recommender.git
#Move into the repository
cd Concert-Recommender
#Install dependencies of the project
npm install
#run the program
npm start
```
